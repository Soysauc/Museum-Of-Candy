# MUSEUM OF CANDY

This project was an optional project following Colt Steele's old web developer course. I fast forwarded through his course to find this project and the technologies used were largely Html, Css and Bootstrap. I hadn't used bootstrap in my original education: Practicum, but it was nice to use here. The website is fully responsive and features a modern design with a bright color pallet.
Near the bottom there is a brief in-HTML JavaScript template literal notation, which was a first time for me. Also my first foray into a small amount of jQuery. This took about an hour when watching the tutorials and following along and moving ahead at times.
