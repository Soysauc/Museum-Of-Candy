# Museum of candy

This project was an optional project following Colt Steele's old web developer course. I fast forwarded through his course to find it and the technologies used were laregly Html, css and Bootstrap. I hadn't used bootstrap in my original education: Practicum, but it was nice to use here. The website is fully responsive and features a modern design with a bright color pallet.
